abstract = {Port energy transition projects (PETPs) are complicated, necessitating stakeholders' collaborative efforts, varying in importance, stakes, priorities, resources and competing interests. The purpose of this study is to provide insights about stakeholder management tools using the life cycle approach. The stakeholder theory and the stakeholders' circle methodology have been utilised to build pathways to manage PETPs’ stakeholders. While twenty-two groups of stakeholders with varying stakes have been identified as potentially involved in the shift to, and implementation of, PETPs, the five-step approach (i.e., identify, prioritise, visualise, engage, monitor) is proposed to manage and engage them and overcome arising challenges. This life cycle approach inspires and enables port mangers and practitioners to effectively identify key stakeholders and then develop engagement strategies to build and maintain robust relationships with them. While seen as a guiding tool, the exhibited life cycle approach fosters trust and collaboration, leading to better decision-making, and resource allocation in PETPs. While this is the first study that addresses the subject matter, it could be regarded as an extended application of the stakeholder theory and stakeholder circle method in the PETPs. Nonetheless, the findings from this research make due contribution to streamlined port energy transition and to stakeholder management.}

abstract = {This article proposes an adaptable incentive framework for an incentive-based demand response (IBDR) program. The framework is based on changes in demand from end-consumers using the bilevel approach to optimize the scheduling of flexible loads. The distribution system operator (DSO) acts as a leader with a multi-objective optimization problem. The objective is to maximize profit while minimizing network energy loss and peak load at the point of common coupling. The DSO’s strategy involves changing demand-based adaptive incentive offers to enhance end-consumers participation in the DR program. Furthermore, the DSO aimed to mitigate phase unbalancing as an objective to address power quality issues caused by imbalances in phase voltage and power. Aggregators are regarded as followers in the bilevel approach, aiming to maximize incentives for mitigating the discomfort caused by scheduling flexible energy resources in the IBDR program. By utilizing Karush-Kuhn–Tucker conditions, the previously mentioned bilevel problem transformed into a single-level optimization problem. This work examined two case studies to determine the effectiveness of the proposed adaptable IBDR model. The efficacy of the proposed framework was assessed on a modified IEEE 25 bus unbalanced distribution system. The evaluation reveals that adaptive IBDR confers advantages to all participants, including DSO and end-consumers.}
