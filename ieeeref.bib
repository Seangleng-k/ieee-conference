abstract = {Port energy transition projects (PETPs) are complicated, necessitating stakeholders' collaborative efforts, varying in importance, stakes, priorities, resources and competing interests. The purpose of this study is to provide insights about stakeholder management tools using the life cycle approach. The stakeholder theory and the stakeholders' circle methodology have been utilised to build pathways to manage PETPs’ stakeholders. While twenty-two groups of stakeholders with varying stakes have been identified as potentially involved in the shift to, and implementation of, PETPs, the five-step approach (i.e., identify, prioritise, visualise, engage, monitor) is proposed to manage and engage them and overcome arising challenges. This life cycle approach inspires and enables port mangers and practitioners to effectively identify key stakeholders and then develop engagement strategies to build and maintain robust relationships with them. While seen as a guiding tool, the exhibited life cycle approach fosters trust and collaboration, leading to better decision-making, and resource allocation in PETPs. While this is the first study that addresses the subject matter, it could be regarded as an extended application of the stakeholder theory and stakeholder circle method in the PETPs. Nonetheless, the findings from this research make due contribution to streamlined port energy transition and to stakeholder management.}

abstract = {This article proposes an adaptable incentive framework for an incentive-based demand response (IBDR) program. The framework is based on changes in demand from end-consumers using the bilevel approach to optimize the scheduling of flexible loads. The distribution system operator (DSO) acts as a leader with a multi-objective optimization problem. The objective is to maximize profit while minimizing network energy loss and peak load at the point of common coupling. The DSO’s strategy involves changing demand-based adaptive incentive offers to enhance end-consumers participation in the DR program. Furthermore, the DSO aimed to mitigate phase unbalancing as an objective to address power quality issues caused by imbalances in phase voltage and power. Aggregators are regarded as followers in the bilevel approach, aiming to maximize incentives for mitigating the discomfort caused by scheduling flexible energy resources in the IBDR program. By utilizing Karush-Kuhn–Tucker conditions, the previously mentioned bilevel problem transformed into a single-level optimization problem. This work examined two case studies to determine the effectiveness of the proposed adaptable IBDR model. The efficacy of the proposed framework was assessed on a modified IEEE 25 bus unbalanced distribution system. The evaluation reveals that adaptive IBDR confers advantages to all participants, including DSO and end-consumers.}

abstract = {Demand response (DR) is expected to play a major role in integrating large shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources in power systems. For example, DR can increase or decrease consumption depending on the VRE availability, and use generating and network assets more efficiently. Detailed DR models are usually very complex, hence, unsuitable for large-scale energy models, where simplicity and linearity are key elements to keep a reasonable computational performance. In contrast, aggregated DR models are usually too simplistic and therefore conclusions derived from them may be misleading. This paper focuses on classifying and modelling DR in large-scale models. The first part of the paper classifies different DR services, and provides an overview of benefits and challenges. The second part presents mathematical formulations for different types of DR ranging from curtailment and ideal shifting, to shifting including saturation and immediate load recovery. Here, we suggest a collection of linear constraints that are appropriate for large-scale power systems and integrated energy system models, but sufficiently sophisticated to capture the key effects of DR in the energy system. We also propose a mixed-integer programming formulation for load shifting that guarantees immediate load recovery, and its linear relaxation better approximates the exact solution compared with previous models.}

DR can provide a sustainable and cost-effective option for supply balancing, especially in a scenario with more volatile inflows from renewable energy sources. End-users can be incentivized to provide DR through time-based pricing in general and dynamic pricing in particular. This paper provides a theoretic framework and practice-oriented review of the status of DR in Europe, outlining the major challenges currently hampering further DR development. Important challenges involve the split-incentive issue for investments in enabling technologies, traditional market rules for flexibility that favor large generation units and the need for electricity market and network operation coordination.}

abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems intensifies the need of enhancing the flexibility in grid operations in order to accommodate the uncertain power output of the leading RES such as wind and solar generation. Utilities have been recently showing increasing interest in developing Demand Response (DR) programs in order to match generation and demand in a more efficient way. Incentive- and price-based DR programs aim at enabling the demand side in order to achieve a range of operational and economic advantages, towards developing a more sustainable power system structure. The contribution of the presented study is twofold. First, a complete and up-to-date overview of DR enabling technologies, programs and consumer response types is presented. Furthermore, the benefits and the drivers that have motivated the adoption of DR programs, as well as the barriers that may hinder their further development, are thoroughly discussed. Second, the international DR status quo is identified by extensively reviewing existing programs in different regions.}

abstract = {Expeditious urbanization, population growth, and technological advancements in the past decade have significantly impacted the rise of energy demand across the world. Mitigation of environmental impacts and socio-economic benefits associated with the renewable energy systems advocate the higher integration of the distributed energy systems into the conventional electricity grids. However, the rise of renewable energy generation increases the intermittent and stochastic nature of the energy management problem significantly. Therefore, an optimal energy management technique is required to achieve a high level of system reliability and operational efficiency. A state-of-the-art systematic review of the different optimization techniques used to address the energy management problems in microgrids is presented in this article. The different optimization techniques used in energy management problems, particularly focusing on forecasting, demand management, economic dispatch, and unit commitment, are identified and critically analyzed in this review. The inferences from the review indicated that the mixed integer programming techniques were widely used, considering their simplicity and performance in solving the energy management problem in microgrids. The multi-agent-based techniques and meta-heuristics algorithms outperformed the other conventional techniques in terms of the efficiency of the system due to the decentralized nature of the EMS problem in microgrids and the capability of these techniques to act effectively in such scenarios. In addition, it was also evident that the use of advanced optimization techniques was limited in the scope of forecasting and demand management. Advocating the need for more accurate scheduling and forecasting algorithms to address the energy management problem in microgrids. Finally, the need for an end-to-end energy management solution for a microgrid system and a transactive/collaborative energy sharing functionality in a community microgrid is presented.}
