abstract = {Port energy transition projects (PETPs) are complicated, necessitating stakeholders' collaborative efforts, varying in importance, stakes, priorities, resources and competing interests. The purpose of this study is to provide insights about stakeholder management tools using the life cycle approach. The stakeholder theory and the stakeholders' circle methodology have been utilised to build pathways to manage PETPs’ stakeholders. While twenty-two groups of stakeholders with varying stakes have been identified as potentially involved in the shift to, and implementation of, PETPs, the five-step approach (i.e., identify, prioritise, visualise, engage, monitor) is proposed to manage and engage them and overcome arising challenges. This life cycle approach inspires and enables port mangers and practitioners to effectively identify key stakeholders and then develop engagement strategies to build and maintain robust relationships with them. While seen as a guiding tool, the exhibited life cycle approach fosters trust and collaboration, leading to better decision-making, and resource allocation in PETPs. While this is the first study that addresses the subject matter, it could be regarded as an extended application of the stakeholder theory and stakeholder circle method in the PETPs. Nonetheless, the findings from this research make due contribution to streamlined port energy transition and to stakeholder management.}
